# Fiddle

This is a simple project, used as a local and raw [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

## Usage

```shell
# To get things going the first time:
$ yarn

# To really get things going:
# This starts a webpack-dev-server that allows you to do simple JavaScript, HTML and CSS stuff with livereload.
$ yarn start

# If you just want to test some javascript stuff in the console/terminal:
# Do note that nodemon will stumble when importing css and using `document` etc.
$ yarn run nodemon

# To run livereload with webpack:
# This starts webpack-dev-server
$ yarn start
```
